# Azeti's Buzzword Bingo

## Decisions made throughout the project
- Changed capitalization to capitalize so words would fit better into their cells
- Changed word-break property so words won't overflow into other cells
- Modified button styles to use CSS Grid so they better fit into the screen

## Things missing
- There's no confirmation prompt when pressing one of the lower buttons. This would be there in a full application.
